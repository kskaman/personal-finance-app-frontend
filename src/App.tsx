/**
 * Code Review Summary & Recommendations
 *
 * 1. **Improve Reusability**:
 *    - Extract shared logic into reusable utility functions and hooks (e.g., modal management, formatting functions).
 *    - Ensure to create reusable components where things are used repeatedly. In some cases, slight differences can be handled with props but that is a fine line and ultimately it is up to you to determine what makes sense to be share and when to split into a separate component.
 *
 * 2. **Optimize Performance**:
 *    - Look into things like `Set` and `Map` for efficient lookups where applicable.
 *    - Look into things like Memoization and useCallback for expensive computations and avoid unnecessary re-renders in context-heavy components.
 *
 * 3. **Continue to Strengthen TypeScript Practices**:
 *    - Use discriminated unions to eliminate unnecessary required props.
 *
 * Overall, the code is well-structured with strong React, TypeScript, and MUI usage. The next step is refining reusability, performance, and testing to further improve maintainability and efficiency.
